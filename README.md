Ansible Examples
=======

This is a collection of Ansible playbooks that I have made public to serve as a reference or starting point for Developers, System Administrators or DevOps professionals.  Feel free to utilize anything you deem userful.

Contents
=======
   * An Ansible configuration file, ansible.cfg
   * A sample hosts file to organize your hosts.  You can learn more about organizing your hosts on the Ansible website.  See <http://docs.ansible.com/intro_inventory.html>.
   * A sample Ansible playbook file, nginx_deploy.yml.
   * The roles call by the nginx_deply playbook, along with additional roles not called, can be found in the roles directory.
